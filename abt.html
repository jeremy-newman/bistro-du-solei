                          We have been there several times and food and
                          service has always been superb. Good appetizer
                          selection (I like the pate) and main courses are
                          varied and good. The bouillabaisse is special- and
                          the short ribs were perfect. I think we have tried
                          most everything on the menu and have never been
                          disappointed. Bringing our own wine is fun and also a
                          money-saver. Somewhat hard to find this restaurant but,
                          believe me it is definitely worth it !!!

                          Great little gem in Westport, Connecticut where the
                          ambiance is cozy and artsy and the cuisine is delicious.
                          The service was great. We brought our own wine and
                          there was no corkage fee. I so enjoyed my escargot
                          appetizer and orange infused scallops on arugula.
                          Both were artfully presented so I knew the tastes
                          would be amazing. My partner quite enjoyed a hearty
                          soup and coq au vin. The aromas were intoxicating,
                          and the yum factor was off the charts!

                          The food is absolutely wonderful, the atmosphere is
                          lovely, and the service is impeccable. I've been there
                           twice and everyone in my party was absolutely awed.
                           For appetizers, we loved the frogs legs (better than
                           we've had anywhere), escargot, and garlic shrimp ...
                           along with the fresh hot bread - yum! For entrees,
                           the bouillabaisse was devine with loads of perfectly
                           cooked seafood, the rack of lamb was delicious, the
                           short ribs special with saffron risotto was amazing.
                           The chef even customized an entree for one of us who
                            had a food allergy and the dish was fantastic.
                            Portions are generous - so be ready for leftovers.
                            It's BYOB. Wonderful for a special dinner, romantic
                            dinner, friends nite out, family treat. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

                        &nbsp &nbsp The latest addition to Westport's dining scene comes
                        with plenty of ready-made fans. Bistro du Soleil has
                        opened on Riverside Avenue, across from Minute Men
                        Cleaners -- between the Black Duck and the train station.
                         Owner Maria Munoz del Castillo earned raves for Rincón
                         Taqueria in Norwalk. She cut her teeth at an earlier
                         Bistro du Soleil, also in Norwalk, owned by her parents,
                          Soledad and Bernardo Munoz del Castillo.
                          <br><br>
                          &nbsp &nbsp That Soleil is now closed, but Bernardo's wizardry
                          is strongly felt in Saugatuck. A craftsman as well
                          as a restaurateur, he lovingly made every table --
                          including the outdoor seating -- as well as the handsome
                          wooden bar. (He's also a playwright and poet.)
                        <br><br>
                          &nbsp &nbsp Soledad and Bernardo came to the U.S. from Chile in
                          the 1980s. Trained as a French chef, she made a name
                          for herself here. In addition to restaurants, Soledad
                          had a catering business -- and was a favorite at the
                          Westport Farmers' Market.
                          <br><br>
                          &nbsp &nbsp The new Soleil's menu is Mediterranean, with French
                          flair. Dinners include salmon, seafood bouillabaisse,
                          grilled rack of lamb, marinated grilled skirt steak,
                          Muscovy duck breast -- and a parrillada with chorizos,
                          skirt steak, pork chops, half chicken, tomato, onion,
                          bell pepper BBQ and cilantro chimichurri
                          that serves 3-4.
                          <br><br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp As politicians, consultants, bridge engineers and
                           ordinary Westporters debate the future of Saugatuck,
                           here's a suggestion: Do it over a meal at
                           Bistro du Soleil.
